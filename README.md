## About

`simple-linked-lists` is a package for creating a linked list structure.  
It provides one `LinkedList` class you can instanciate and populate with `LinkedListNode` instances.

## Install

`npm install --save simple-linked-lists`  
`yarn add simple-linked-lists`

## Usage

`simple-linked-lists` exports a `LinkedList` and a `LinkedListNode` classes you can import :

```javascript
// ES6
import { LinkedList, LinkedListNode } from "simple-linked-lists";

// ES5
const LinkedList = require("simple-linked-lists").LinkedList;
const LinkedListNode = require("simple-linked-lists").LinkedListNode;
```

Once imported, you just have to instanciate nodes and add them to the list to have an usable linked list.

```javascript
import { LinkedList, LinkedListNode } from "simple-linked-lists";

const node = new LinkedListNode();
const list = new LinkedList();

list.addToHead(node); // Add the node to the head of the list
list.addToTail(node); // Add the node to the tail of the list
list.removeHead(); // Remove the head node of the list
list.removeTail(); // Remove the tail node of the list
```

You can extend the `LinkedListNode` to create your own data set you can put in the list.
